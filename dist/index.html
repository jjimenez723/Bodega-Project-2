    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p>Building on <strong>Team Flow Chain’s</strong> groundbreaking work, this community-driven initiative aims to create a resilient, sustainable food supply chain linking local farms and school gardens directly to Newark’s bodegas. At the heart of this model is the belief that food access is a fundamental right for everyone.</p>
    <p>Supported by <strong>Bergen Community College</strong>, a federally designated Hispanic-Serving Institution, and <strong>Rutgers Business School–Newark</strong>, a leading hub for urban economic development and innovation, this project is uniquely positioned to make meaningful, lasting change. The project originated under the visionary leadership of <strong>Dr. Kevin Lyons</strong>, Associate Professor at Rutgers Business School, whose commitment to sustainable urban logistics inspired this impactful partnership.</p>
    <p>Generously funded by the <strong>USDA</strong> and <strong>NIFA</strong>, under the leadership and coordination of <strong>Dr. Edward Sanchez</strong>, this initiative emphasizes experiential learning and leadership training in key areas such as agriculture, business, food systems, and environmental science, empowering students and communities alike.</p>

    <h2>Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)</h2>
    <p class="kpi-intro">Team Flow Chain's experience highlighted the critical importance of tracking key performance metrics. The following indicators help evaluate and ensure ongoing success and sustainability:</p>
    <ul class="kpi-list">
      <li><strong>Inventory Shortage:</strong> Minimizing losses due to theft, damage, fraud, or miscounts.</li>
      <li><strong>Supplier Lead Time:</strong> Reducing the duration from placing orders to product shipment.</li>
      <li><strong>Warehouse Utilization:</strong> Optimizing the ratio of used to available warehouse space.</li>
      <li><strong>Cold Chain Compliance:</strong> Ensuring safe and reliable temperature control throughout transportation.</li>
      <li><strong>Delivery Time Variability:</strong> Narrowing gaps between expected and actual delivery times.</li>
      <li><strong>Delivery Accuracy:</strong> Maximizing the percentage of on-time, undamaged deliveries.</li>

  <section class="content-section">
    <h2>Urban Agriculture: Indoor Vertical Farming</h2>
    <ul class="vertical-farming-list">
      <li><strong>Year-Round Production:</strong> Enables continuous farming independent of weather and seasonal changes.</li>
      <li><strong>Local Food Security:</strong> Strengthens food systems by significantly reducing transportation emissions and reliance on distant suppliers.</li>
      <li><strong>Controlled Environments:</strong> Controlled environments allows for measuring TDS (total dissolved solids) of nutrients in water, easy managing of pests, as well as a controlled light source.</li>
      <li><strong>Frequent Harvests:</strong> Hydroponic vertical farming allows selected crops to grow faster, leading to more frequent harvests.</li>
